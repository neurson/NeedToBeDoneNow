# NeedToBeDoneNow

This is a learning project for mastering NodeJS and Javascript.

It’s a REST like API (not RESTful) that exposes a tasks management service.

Yes, this is an another « TODO » app. Pretty boring… :)

For now, I have a basic tests suite that consumes the service and ensures is sanity.

The service handles authentication, but this is « Basic Authentication ». This type of authentication is only secure over HTTPS.

This is mostly what I used to build this project:
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
- [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/)
- [Passport](http://passportjs.org/)
- [Mongo](http://www.mongodb.org/)
- [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/)
- [SuperTest](https://github.com/tj/supertest)
- [EPA](https://github.com/derickbailey/epa)

**Please don’t use this project as a reference on how to build a REST like api with Node JS.**
